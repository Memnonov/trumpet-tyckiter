TRUMPET TYCKITER SIMULATOR
==========================
Now you can play the trumpet too.
Made using SDL2.
Doot doot doot.  

'a', 's' and 'd' control the air velocity and the initial pitch of the instrument.  
Arrow keys left, down and right control the valves.  
A real trumpet player will know what to do...  
(Hint: The valves lower the pitch)

Need to play higher notes? Practice harder.  

requires SDL2, SDL2_image and SDL2_mixer.
cmake works on Arch at least.
